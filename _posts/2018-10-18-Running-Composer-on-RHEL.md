Weldr aka. Composer can generate custom images suitable for deploying systems, or as
images ready to upload the cloud. It works great on Fedora, but on Red Hat Enterpise Linux
there's an additional wrinkle.

Composer uses [Anaconda](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda) and [Lorax](https://weldr.io/lorax/)
tooling to prepare these images, much like Red Hat prepares it's own distributed images.
However neither Anaconda nor Lorax can read from Red Hat's content distribution network,
and so have a hard time working with the sources of RPM content available.

This is an embarrassing gap, that we're working to fix. In the meantime, here's how to
use the ```reposync``` tooling to work around it. We're going to mirror the Red Hat
repositories locally and use that as a source of content for Composer.

## Prerequisites

We'll use [RHEL 7.5](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/7.5_release_notes/index)
 as our version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for running this document. Make sure to have at
least 50 gigabytes of disk space to run this. Due to the way [Lorax](http://weldr.io/lorax/) works
it make changes to the operating system its running on, so don't use this system for
other tasks:

Make sure your system is subscribed:

    $ sudo subscription-manager status
    +-------------------------------------------+
       System Status Details
    +-------------------------------------------+
    Overall Status: Current

If necessary run a command like the following to subscribe the system:

    $ sudo subscription-manager --auto-attach register
    Username: example@email.com
    Password:
    The system has been registered with ID: cca2f23d-6167-4df1-b149-5a0ca1866d53
    The registered system name is: m1.example.lan
    Product Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
    Status:       Subscribed

Make sure you have enough disk space mounted at ```/var/www``` which is where our mirror will live:

    $ df -h /var/www/
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda         99G   61M   94G   1% /var/www

## Mirror the required repositories

Now we install the necessary mirroring tools itself:

    $ sudo yum install yum-utils createrepo httpd

Now lets look at the identifiers of the repositiories we're going to mirror:

    $ sudo yum repolist
    Loaded plugins: product-id, search-disabled-repos, subscription-manager
    repo id                           repo name                               status
    rhel-7-server-rpms/7Server/x86_64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server (RPMs 21,082
    repolist: 26,341

For each repository you want to mirror use the following command. Notice how we specify the
repository identifier as the argument to the commands:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html
    $ sudo reposync --gpgcheck -l --download_path=/var/www/html --repoid rhel-7-server-rpms --downloadcomps --download-metadata
    $ cd /var/www/html/rhel-7-server-rpms
    $ createrepo -v /var/www/html/rhel-7-server-rpms -g comps.xml

Make sure the repos have the correct SELinux context so that httpd (Apache) can access
the files that have been mirrored, and start up the web server:

    $ chcon -vR -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/
    $ systemctl start httpd

Also, make sure httpd is accessible from the outside:

    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http && firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent

## Configure Composer to use the mirrors

Now we install the Composer itself:

    $ sudo yum install lorax-composer cockpit-composer cockpit composer-cli

Next make sure to turn off [SELinux](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/ch-selinux) on the system. Lorax doesn't yet work properly with
SELinux running, as it installs an entire OS image in an alternate directory:

    $ sudo setenforce 0
    $ sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config

Place an repository config in ```/etc/yum.repos.d``` to point to the content you've
mirrored above. Make sure to include the IP address or hostname of the system you've
mirrored the content onto.

    $ sudo cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/mirror.repo <<EOF
    [mirror-rhel-7-server-rpms]
    name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server
    baseurl=http://<ip_address>/cdrom/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
    EOF

Now verify the client configuration:

    $ sudo yum clean all
    $ sudo yum repolist

If you're running both the mirror and Composer on the same system, then disable the
subscribed repositories like this:

    $ sudo yum-config-manager --disable rhel-7-server-rpms

Now enable and start ```lorax-composer``` system service:

    $ sudo systemctl enable --now lorax-composer.socket

If you're going to use [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) UI to drive Composer
(see below), you can also enable it like this:

    $ sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit && firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent

## Compose an image from the UI

To compose an image in Composer, log into the *Cockpit Web Console* with your web browser.
It's running on port ```9090``` on the VM that you're running Composer in. Use any admin
or ```root``` Linux system credentials to log in.  Select the *Image Builder* tab.

![Cockpit Composer](/images/cockpit-composer-main.png)

We first have to have a *blueprint* defined. This blueprint describes what goes into the image.
For the purposes of this example we'll use the ```example-http-server``` blueprint, which
builds an image that contains a basic HTTP server.

Click on the *Create Image* button and choose an image type from the dropdown
to choose the *Image Type*:

![Create Image AMI](/images/cockpit-composer-create-ami.png)

If you click on the blueprint, you should see progress described on the Images tab:

![Create Image Progress](/images/cockpit-composer-progress.png)

Once it's done, download the image:

![Download Image](/images/cockpit-composer-download.png)

## Compose an image from the CLI

To compose an image in Composer from the command line, we first have to have a *blueprint*
defined. This blueprint describes what goes into the image. For the purposes of this
example we'll use the ```example-http-server``` blueprint, which builds an image that
contains a basic HTTP server.

We run the following command to start a compose. Notice that we pass the image type
of ```qcow2``` which makes an image bootable in RHEV or KVM.

    $ sudo composer-cli compose start example-http-server qcow2
    Compose 8db1b463-91ee-4fd9-8065-938924398428 added to the queue

Now check the status of the compose like this:

    $ sudo composer-cli compose status
    8db1b463-91ee-4fd9-8065-938924398428 RUNNING  Mon Oct  8 08:11:33 2018 example-http-server 0.0.1 qcow2

In order to diagnose a failure or look for more detailed progress, see:

    $ sudo journalctl -fu lorax-composer
    ...

When it's done you can download the resulting image into the current directory:

    $ sudo composer-cli compose image 8db1b463-91ee-4fd9-8065-938924398428
    8db1b463-91ee-4fd9-8065-938924398428-disk.qcow2: 1460.00 MB
